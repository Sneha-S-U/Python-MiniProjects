1.PIG Game:
PIG is a simple dice game that is traditionally played with two players. The goal is to reach a set score (usually 50) before your opponent. Players take turns rolling a die, and on each roll, they can either "hold" to save their score or roll again to accumulate more points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn.

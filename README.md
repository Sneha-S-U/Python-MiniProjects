1.PIG Game:
PIG is a simple dice game that is traditionally played with two players. The goal is to reach a set score (usually 50) before your opponent. Players take turns rolling a die, and on each roll, they can either "hold" to save their score or roll again to accumulate more points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn.


2.Guess The Number:
The "Guess the Number" game is a simple Python program where you can either guess a number chosen by the computer or have the computer guess a number that you think of.
